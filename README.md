# TOV-solution-for-quark-stars

06/04/2020

solution_2.py solves Tolmann - Oppenheimer - Volkoff equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff_equation) for quark stars.
For those stars state equation is given as: P = c^2 / 3 * (rho - rho_0), where rho_0 (central density) in this code was given as 10^15 * (0.5 + 1/7) g*cm^-3

Using TOV equation code calculates radius - mass relations for quark stars and their maximum mass. There are also 3 files generated giving density - radius relations for 3 values of central density.
Output files can be seen in 'output' directory, where you can also find graphs made out of these files.
